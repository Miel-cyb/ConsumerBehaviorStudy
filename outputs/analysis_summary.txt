### Behavioral Insights and HCI Interpretation

1. **Consumer Behavior Trends:**
   Most respondents' purchasing decisions are influenced by factors like discounts, product availability, and social influence. 
   These external factors (such as trends and economic changes) correlate strongly with consumer willingness to buy, aligning with the 
   idea that sudden external stimuli shape online purchase decisions.

2. **Online vs. Offline Shopping:**
   Logistic regression analysis indicates that online shopping preference is modestly predicted by factors tied to digital trust, 
   product consistency, and exposure to online promotions. However, many respondents still favor physical shopping — suggesting that 
   usability issues, trust, and sensory experience remain barriers.

3. **Relation to Human–Computer Interaction (HCI):**
   - **Usability & Trust:** Some consumers may find online interfaces unintuitive or insecure, reducing adoption.
   - **Cognitive Load:** Too many steps, unclear navigation, or poor feedback loops discourage repeat online purchases.
   - **Experience Gap:** Lack of tactile or social interaction (core elements of user experience) reduces satisfaction.
   - **Design Implication:** To promote online shopping adoption, e-commerce interfaces must emphasize clarity, accessibility, 
     responsive design, and personalization.

4. **Conclusion:**
   The experiment supports that while discounts and convenience push consumers toward online channels, the HCI quality of 
   e-commerce platforms directly affects long-term user trust and preference.
